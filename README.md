# warp-example

I wanted to play around with a very basic [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) project to get a feel for how it works.

This repo is based on the blog post called [Create an async CRUD web service in Rust with warp](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-an-async-crud-web-service-in-rust-with-warp/), except it uses [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) instead of [mobc](https://github.com/importcjj/mobc)/[mobc-postgres](https://github.com/importcjj/mobc-postgres).
